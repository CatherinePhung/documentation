title: XML Format
---

The State Decoded parser can either be modified to use bespoke PHP to parse a legal code in its native format, or it can parse a prescribed XML format. This is a totally invented XML format. There is no legal code that is provided in this format. It is provided as an option because, via [XSLT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT), it can be substantially easier to convert an existing XML to this format than to write a parser for it in PHP.
