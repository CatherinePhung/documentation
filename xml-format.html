title: XML Format

<p>The State Decoded parser can either be modified to use bespoke PHP to parse a legal code in its native format, or it can parse a prescribed XML format. This is a totally invented XML format. There is no legal code that is provided in this format. It is provided as an option because, via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>, it can be substantially easier to convert an existing XML to this format than to write a parser for it in PHP.</p>

<p>The State Decoded has <a href="https://github.com/statedecoded/statedecoded/blob/master/sample.xsl">a sample XSLT file</a> on which you can base your own XSLT. It is well commented and verbose, so even if you’re not familiar with XSLT, you’ve got a fighting chance of transforming your XML to The State Decoded’s format.</p>

<p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an effort to create a standard interchange or storage format for legal codes. This exists solely as a convenience for importing data into The State Decoded.</p>

<h1>Terminology</h1>

Legal codes throughout the U.S. all use different terminology (e.g., "statutes" vs "code" vs "laws"). We need to adopt some terminology here, and while it can't be the right terminology everywhere, we hope to avoid any disputes about what exactly is the right terminology. The terminology we've adopted was the simplest that also reflected the reality of the data. A lot of people implementing The State Decoded are programmers, not attorneys, and the terminology that the project uses needs to reflect the reality of that user base.

Below, the word "law" refers to what some jurisdictions would call a section, and it's usually prefixed with the § symbol. It corresponds to a single page on a State Decoded website.

Within a "law", we use "section" elements to represent the hierarchical structure of the paragraphs within it. In some jurisdictions this would be called a subsection. A "section" corresponds to a paragraph plus any logically nested (typically indented) content within it.

<h1>Descriptive Specifications</h1>

<ul>
<li>There must be one file per law.</li>
<li>All files must be in the same directory.</li>
<li>The names of the files are irrelevant.</li>
<li>Every file contains both structural data about its container—which chapter/title/part/article/etc. that it's within—and data about the law itself.</li>
<li>Text must be broken up by subsection, rather than provided as a single block of text, unless the text of the law does not have subsections.</li>
<li>Subsections may be nested.</li>
</ul>

<p>This being open source software, some relatively simple tweaks to <code>Parser::iterate</code> and <code>Parser::parse</code> make all of these specifications malleable.</p>

<h1>Fields</h1>

<ul>
<li>law: the container for all other fields—required
<ul><li>structure: the container for structural units (chapters, titles, articles, parts, etc.)—required</li>
<li>unit: a single structural unit that contains this law—required
<ul><li>label: the type of structural unit that this is (chapter, title, article, part, etc.)—required</li>
<li>identifier: the unique identifier for this structural unit, almost always a number (e.g., 18.2, 6)—required</li>
<li>order<em>by: when listing all structural units of this label, in what ordinal position this structural unit should appear—optional</li>
<li>level: a whole number, starting at one, indicating the depth of this structural unit—required</li></ul></li>
<li>section</em>number: the unique identifier for this law—required</li>
<li>catch<em>line: the title of this law—required</li>
<li>order</em>by: when listing all laws within this structural unit, in what ordinal position this law should appear—optional</li>
<li>text: the container for the text of the law itself—required</li>
<li>section: a single labelled section of a law—optional
<ul><li>prefix: the identifying label for this section (e.g., A, 6, vi)—required</li>
<li>type: the type of material within this section; default is text, other options are "table" and "image"—optional</li></ul></li>
<li>history: the textual description of the history of amendments to this law—optional</li>
<li>metadata: a container for any additional fields, which will be stored as key:value in the <code>laws_meta</code> table—optional; values of <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> will be stored in the database as <code>y</code> and <code>n</code>, respectively, but converted back to <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> within the internal and external APIs</li></ul></li>
</ul>
