title: XML Format
layout: default

<p>The State Decoded parser can either be modified to use bespoke PHP to parse a legal code in its native format, or it can parse a prescribed XML format. This is a totally invented XML format. There is no legal code that is provided in this format. It is provided as an option because, via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>, it can be substantially easier to convert an existing XML to this format than to write a parser for it in PHP.</p>

<p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an effort to create a standard interchange or storage format for legal codes. This exists solely as a convenience for important data into The State Decoded.</p>

<h1>Descriptive Specifications</h1>

<ul>
<li>There must be one file per law.</li>
<li>All files must be in the same directory.</li>
<li>The names of the files are irrelevant.</li>
<li>Every file contains both structural data about its container—which chapter/title/part/article/etc. that it's within—and data about the law itself.</li>
<li>Text must be broken up by subsection, rather than provided as a single block of text, unless the text of the law does not have subsections.</li>
<li>Subsections may be nested.</li>
</ul>

<p>This being open source software, some relatively simple tweaks to <code>Parser::iterate</code> and <code>Parser::parse</code> make all of these specifications malleable.</p>

<h1>Fields</h1>

<ul>
<li>law: the container for all other fields—required
<ul><li>structure: the container for structural units (chapters, titles, articles, parts, etc.)—required</li>
<li>unit: a single structural unit that contains this law—required
<ul><li>label: the type of structural unit that this is (chapter, title, article, part, etc.)—required</li>
<li>identifier: the unique identifier for this structural unit, almost always a number (e.g., 18.2, 6)—required</li>
<li>order<em>by: when listing all structural units of this label, in what ordinal position this structural unit should appear—optional</li>
<li>level: a whole number, starting at one, indicating the depth of this structural unit—required</li></ul></li>
<li>section</em>number: the unique identifier for this law—required</li>
<li>catch<em>line: the title of this law—required</li>
<li>order</em>by: when listing all laws within this structural unit, in what ordinal position this law should appear—optional</li>
<li>text: the container for the text of the law itself—required</li>
<li>section: a single labelled section of a law—optional
<ul><li>prefix: the identifying label for this section (e.g., A, 6, vi)—required</li>
<li>type: the type of material within this section; default is text, other options are "table" and "image"—optional</li></ul></li>
<li>history: the textual description of the history of amendments to this law—optional</li>
<li>metadata: a container for any additional fields, which will be stored as key:value in the <code>laws_meta</code> table—optional; values of <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> will be stored in the database as <code>y</code> and <code>n</code>, respectively, but converted back to <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> within the internal and external APIs</li></ul></li>
