# Master template file
Duplicate `includes/templates/default.inc.php` (to, say, `/includes/templates/kansas.inc.php`), then edit `TEMPLATE` in `includes/config.inc.php` to read `kansas` instead of `default`. `kansas.inc.php` is now your site's page template.

# Images
There is a [State Decoded Assets repository](https://github.com/statedecoded/statedecoded-assets/) that contains PSD files of page mockups and a favicon. These may be modified to customize the site's images as you see fit.

# CSS
You will be happiest if you do not CSS files directly. Instead, create a new CSS file (e.g., `/static/css/kansas.css`) and start it with the following line:

```html
@import url("application.css");
```

Then add your CSS declarations on top of that. This way, as subsequent releases of The State Decoded add modify the bundled CSS to add new functionality, you will gain that functionality in your own design. Then, in your template (e.g., `includes/templates/kansas.inc.php`), have it load `/static/css/kansas.css` instead of `/static/css.application.css`.

Better still, if you're comfortable with SCSS, do the same, but by creating a new SCSS file (e.g., `/static/scss/kansas.scss`) that leads off by importing `application.scss`, and then use that to generate `/static/css/application.css`.

# Caching
If you're running Varnish or mod_pagespeed on your server, you'll need to clear out your cache after making design changes. That's important for Varnish, which caches whole pages. mod_pagespeed should automatically expire its cached assets (Javascript, CSS, and images) when you change them, but if it doesn't, you'll need [flush its cache manually](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/system#flush_cache).

# Home Page Layout
If you do not have video to feature on your site's home page, you can simply remove the entire `<div class="nest video">[â€¦]</div>` stanza from `htdocs/index.php`.
