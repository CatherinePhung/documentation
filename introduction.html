<h1>What It Does</h1>

The State Decoded is a program that takes structured legal data and generates a website, an API, and bulk downloads based on that legal data. It was designed for U.S. state and municipal legal codes, but it works just as nicely for regulations, contracts, even EULAs. It interfaces with court decisions, legislation, and arbitrary types of connected legal data.</p>

<h1>Who It’s For</h1>

<p>Governments, open-government groups, lone data hackers, law libraries, or anybody else who wants to put legal data online.</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>If you are using The State Decoded for a legal code or for regulations, you must have an ongoing source of updates to those laws to keep your website current. This is an essential element without which you would be foolish to proceed.</p>

<h1>A Stern Warning About Data Quality</h1>

<p>By putting a legal code online, you are providing information that, inevitably, people will rely on. You’re implicitly making an agreement to the public that you will present accurate information and keep that information on your site up-to-date. You mustn’t start a site like this on a lark. You’re making an indefinite commitment in the public interest.</p>
